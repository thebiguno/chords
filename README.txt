These songs are arranged to fit in a half size binder (5.5x8.5") when printed in
duplex mode.

The margins and page size on the .odf files are designed to handle the hole punching process.

To print these, do the following steps:
1) Generate a PDF using the "Export as PDF" button. 
2) Convert to booklet format using the command 'pdfbook --short-edge <ExportedPDF>'
3) Print resulting .pdf in duplex with short edge mode.
4) Cut the paper exactly in half (on the 14cm mark)
5) Punch holes for the half size binder
