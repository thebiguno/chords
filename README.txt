These songs are meant to be viewed on a device as a single PDF with table of contents.  To edit them,
you need to use Open Office.

To convert them all to a single PDF, run the script "compile_linux" (or "compile_osx" if you are on Mac).  Windows
users are out of luck, sorry.

These scripts use the headless soffice program to convert to .pdf, then combine all the individual PDFs with 
Ghostscript.
